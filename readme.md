# Running Calculations

A project containing functions to analyse a runners training data (from a specific run).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running in your projects. 

### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites required for this project,

### Installing
running-calculations can be used in both node.js and in the browser.

Install math.js using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/running-calculations):
```
npm install running-calculations
```

## Usage
Using Running Calculations is incredibly simple. Examples of every function in use can be seen below:

###Â Types

#### Measurements
Enumeration of supported measurement types in this system

#### Possibilities
```typescript
    measurements.miles
    measurments.kilometres
```

### Coordinates
Typically used for an array of coordinates. Each object will have a longitude (lng) and latitude (lat) point. 

#### Example

```typescript
    import { coordinate } from 'running-calculations';
    const coordinatesArr:coordinate[] = [
        {
            lat: [latitude coordinate],
            lng: [longitude coordinate]
        }
    ]
```

### Calculate Elevation
Converts elevation in metres to feet.

#### Example

```typescript
    import { calculateElevation, measurements } from 'running-calculations';
    const elevation = calculateElevation(1, measurements.miles); // Answer will be 3.2808
```

### Calculate running speed from 2 coordinates
Returns speed (in metres per second) from 2 coordinate types

```typescript
    import { speedFromCoordinates, coordinates } from 'running-calculations';

    const coords1:coordinates = {lat: [latitude], lng: [longitude]};
    const coords2:coordinates = {lat: [latitude], lng: [longitude]};
    const speed = speedFromCoordinates(coords1, coords2);
```

### Calculate running efficiency factor
Returns an efficiency factor from a running pace (ideally a graded pace) and a heart rate value. For comparison reasons, this would ideally be used for runs on the same course and conditions (time, weather, etc).

NOTE: Speed value is in metres per second.

```typescript
    import { calculateEfficiencyFactor } from 'running-calculations';
    const runningPace = 4.76;
    const heartrate = 150;
    const speed = calculateEfficiencyFactor(runningPace, heartrate);
```

### Convert distance from metres
Convert a distance in metres to either miles or kilometres

```typescript
    import { convertDistance, measurements } from 'running-calculations';
    const distance = 1000;
    const speed = convertDistance(distance, measurements.miles);
```

### Calculate a running pace

Converts running pace from metres per second to minute/miles or minute/kilometres

```typescript
    import { calculateAveragePace, measurements } from 'running-calculations';
    const pace = 4.76;
    const speed = calculateAveragePace(pace, measurements.miles);
```

### Calculate a running pace to m/s

Converts running pace from minute/miles or minute/kilometres to metres per second

```typescript
    import { reverseAveragePace, measurements } from 'running-calculations';
    const pace = '6:18';
    const speed = reverseAveragePace(pace, measurements.miles);
```

### Using FTP calculate training zones.
Uses functional threshold pace to calculate training zones for a runner to train in.

```typescript
    import { calculateZonesFromFTP } from 'running-calculations';
    const pace = 4.76;
    const speed = calculateZonesFromFTP(pace);
```

### Calculating percentage of VO2 MAX
Using the finish time for a race, calculate the % of VO2 Max. 
Calculation from the Jack Daniels Tables

```typescript
    import { calculatePercentageVO2Max } from 'running-calculations';
    const raceTime = 5075; // 1:24:35 in seconds
    const VO2Max = calculatePercentageVO2Max(raceTime); // 86.4 %
```

### Calculating VDot score from a race performance
Using the finish time for a race, calculate the VDot score of the race.
Calculation from the Jack Daniels Tables

```typescript
    import { calculateVDOT } from 'running-calculations';
    const raceTime = 5075; // 1:24:35 in seconds
    const VO2Max = calculateVDOT(raceTime); // 54.76 VDot Score
```

### Calculating the training stress score of a run
Using funtional threshold pace, average pace (ideally a graded pace), and time (in seconds),
calculate the training stress score of a run

```typescript
    import { calculateTrainingStressScore, reverseAveragePace, measurements } from 'running-calculations';
    const ngp = reverseAveragePace('6:28', measurements.miles);
    const ftp = reverseAveragePace('6:18', measurements.miles);
    const time = 5075;

    calculateTrainingStressScore(ftp, ngp, time)) // 133.8
```

### Calculating the chronic training load of a runner
Calculate the chronic training load of a runner using their their previous runs TSS over a 42 day period.

```typescript
  import { calculateChronicTrainingLoad } from 'running-calculations';
  const tssData = [
      50.17, 37.07, 51.68,  68.96,
      61.05, 70.57, 91.11,  52.73,
      55.37, 43.79, 42.06,   2.02,
       7.19, 55.71, 45.72,  36.62,
      32.81, 32.56, 39.39, 114.48,
      10.05, 49.58, 84.34
    ];
  calculateChronicTrainingLoad(tssData) // 49.35
```

### Calculating the acute training load of a runner
Calculate the acute training load of a runner using their their previous runs TSS over a 7 day period.

```typescript
  import { calculateAcuteTrainingLoad } from 'running-calculations';
  const tssData = [50.17,37.07];
  calculateAcuteTrainingLoad(tssData) // 43.62
```

### Calculating the training stress balance
Calculate the acute training load of a runner using their their previous runs TSS over a 7 day period.

```typescript
  import { calculateChronicTrainingLoad, calculateAcuteTrainingLoad, calculateTrainingStressBalance } from 'running-calculations';
  const ctl = calculateChronicTrainingLoad(...);
  const atl = calculateAcuteTrainingLoad(...);

  calculateTrainingStressBalance(ctl, atl)) // 5.73
```

### Calculating the chronic training load of a runner
Calculate the acute training load of a runner using their their previous runs TSS over a 7 day period.

```typescript
  import { reverseAveragePace, calculateIntensityFactor } from 'running-calculations';
  const ngp = reverseAveragePace('6:28', measurements.miles);
  const ftp = reverseAveragePace('6:18', measurements.miles);

  calculateIntensityFactor(ftp, ngp) // 0.97
```
